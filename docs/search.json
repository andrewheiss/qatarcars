    "text": "{qatarcars} provides a more internationally-focused, modern cars-based demonstration dataset. It mirrors many of the columns in mtcars, but uses (1) non-US-centric makes and models, (2) 2025 prices, and (3) metric measurements, making it more appropriate for use as an example dataset outside the United States. It includes almost exactly the same variables as the mtcars dataset:\n\norigin (the country associated with the car brand)\nmake (the brand of the car, such as Toyota or Land Rover)\nmodel (the specific type of car, such as Land Cruiser or Defender)\nlength, width, and height (all in meters)\ntrunk capacity (measured in liters)\nfuel economy (measured in liters per 100 km)\nperformance (time in seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h)\nmass in kilograms\nprice in 2025 Qatari riyals\ntype (the type of the car, such as coupe, sedan, or SUV)\nenginetype (electric, hybrid, or petrol)\n\nThe original data was compiled by Paul Musgrave in January 2025 and is mostly sourced from YallaMotors Qatar. See Paul’s writeup of the background and purpose of the data; access his original Stata data here.\n\n\n{qatarcars} is not (yet?) on CRAN, but the development version can be installed with {remotes}:\nlibrary(remotes)\ninstall_github('andrewheiss/qatarcars')\n\n\n\nFuel efficiency gets worse as cars get heavier!\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(qatarcars)\n\nggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = mass, y = economy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mass (kg)\", y = \"Fuel economy (L/100km)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of these cars are really expensive, so logging is helpful:\n\nggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = performance, y = price)) +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  geom_point(aes(color = type)) +\n  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_currency(prefix = \"QR \")) +\n  labs(x = \"Fuel economy (L/100km)\", y = \"Price\")",
